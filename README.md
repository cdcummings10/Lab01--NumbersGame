## Description
This is a simple calculation game that takes in user input to create an array of the user specified length, and 
fills the array with user specified numbers.  It then sums and calculates a product based on the sum times a user
specified number from the array. Lastly, that product is divided by a user inputted value. All results are then displayed.
